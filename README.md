# Learning React Text Editor

This project is a work in progress as I am currently learning to work with React. The application is not yet fully functional, and I'm still exploring and experimenting with React concepts.

## Note

Please be aware that this repository is primarily for educational purposes, and the current state of the application may not represent a fully functional text editor. I appreciate your understanding as I continue to refine my skills with React.
